## Environmental Monitoring Platform

This project is a simple implementation of an Environmental Monitoring Platform in Java. It simulates the collection of environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality using a virtual sensor.

### Features

- Generates random environmental data (temperature, humidity, and air quality).
- Prints the generated data to the console.

### How to Use

1. **Compile the Code**: Compile the Java file `EnvironmentalMonitoringPlatform.java` using the command `javac EnvironmentalMonitoringPlatform.java`.
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled class file using `java EnvironmentalMonitoringPlatform`. This will generate and display environmental data on the console.

### Sample Output

```
Environmental Data:
Temperature: 21.843 Â°C
Humidity: 60.127 %
Air Quality: 75.092

```

### Further Improvements

This implementation serves as a basic starting point. You can extend it further by adding features such as:

- Data logging to store the generated data.
- Real-time data visualization.
- Integration with actual sensors for live data collection.
